# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Peter Cross

# Background
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here is the data for the project:

# Using run_analysis.R
To use this script, there is minor user input needed (depending on if the script is not located in the same directory as the data).
### If the script is in the same directory as the extracted data:
Comment out lines 8 and 15
### If the script is *not* located in the same directory as the extracted data:
Update line 8 to reflect the directory where the extracted data is.
